# Digital Image Processing

Welcome to the **Digital Image Processing** repository! This repository contains implementations of various image processing techniques using MATLAB.

## Features
- Grayscale and binary image conversion
- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, fusion)
- Geometric transformations (rotation, scaling, translation)
- Negative image processing
- Logical operations on images
- Histogram equalization and enhancement
- 2D Fourier Transform Operations
- Linear Filtering
- Image Edge Detection

## Requirements
Ensure you have MATLAB installed with the Image Processing Toolbox.

## Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vikash-kushwah/Digital-Image-Processing.git
cd Digital-Image-Processing
```

Run the MATLAB scripts to perform different image processing tasks:

```matlab
script_name
```

Replace `script_name` with the actual script you want to run.
